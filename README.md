## Prerequisites

You need to first download the [yolov3](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Annk_cU7EjkpgQMm81Rj9HKkUZGz) model weights.

Once installed, place them in the main folder (.../TM)
 
## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

First launch the gui, then select an image/video.

This will create a processed copy of the original file in the same folder as the original was.
